# Project: Build a Personal Website

## Learning Goals

- Build a website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- Publish a website

## Introduction

You've been learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript over the previous lessons. You've
been receiving specific guidance ("Use a `<link>` tag!") and have been steered
by our documentation or tests. In an effort to help you build your confidence,
we're going to give you _nothing_ except some specifications and leave the
document structure and styling _to you_. It's time to tie all your learning
together into one project. You must create...

..._a personal website_!

Professional software engineers and web developers often have a personal
website. In some ways, it is the industry's alternative to a business card. A
personal website can showcase your abilities while also giving visitors a sense
of your personality.

## Requirements

This project is an opportunity to showcase what you've learned so far, so it is
important that HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are incorporated into the project in
some way. For example, you could use a `mouseover` event to change the
appearance of an element when the user mouses over it. Or use a `click` event to
toggle some content between being visible and hidden. There are a variety of
ways to do this using the CSS and JavaScript you've learned so far, but don't
forget you can always use Google if you get stuck. Google is an invaluable tool
for developers! Try to use this project as an opportunity to stretch your coding
skills!

The content, styling, and functionality of your site are up to you. Keep in mind
that you may show this project to your peers and future instructors, so be
considerate of content/subject matter and your potential audience.

## Getting Started and a Recommended Workflow

In the previous two lessons, you:

- Created local and remote repos for your project and connected them together
- Created the base files for your project: `README.md`, `index.html`,
  `style.css`, and `index.js`
- Published your new site on GitHub Pages.

With all of this in place, you are ready to start working on the _content_,
_styles_, and _behavior_ you want your site to have. Because your site is
published on GitHub Pages, you'll be able to continuously push updates to your
site _as you build it_.

In general, when it comes to building code-related projects, it is often best to
establish a routine of making small improvements, checking to make sure those
improvements work and don't break things. This routine might look something like
the following:

1) Write some HTML, CSS or JavaScript
2) Go to your browser and refresh the page to see the changes
3) Adjust your code and repeat until you're satisfied
4) Move on to the next task and repeat the process

It is very common to get lost in coding and to keep going from one task to the
next without checking your work. The problem here is that if you make a mistake
it becomes more and more difficult to spot and debug the error.

By frequently checking your work, you'll set your own project milestones — at
each one, you can verify everything is working so when you _do_ make a mistake,
you'll know it was made recently.

## Professional Git Development Workflow

When it comes to Git, there is ultimately no rule that says you _must_ do things
a certain way. However, if there was anything we could impart to you regarding
good version control habits, it would be this — commit code frequently.

As mentioned, it is a common habit to dive into the code of a project and write
as much as you can, for as long as you can. However, not only does this increase
the chance for bugs, it will result in very large Git commits or just _one_ big
commit for everything.

Repositories with a good commit history can relay a story about their
development from just the commit messages alone. For example, instead of the
commit history looking like this:

- Commit 1: "Initialize Repository"
- Commit 2: "Finish website"

A good history might look closer to this:

- Commit 1: "Initialize Repository"
- Commit 2: "Add basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript files"
- Commit 3: "Create initial HTML content"
- Commit 4: "Add CSS rules"
- Commit 5: "Fix syntax issue in HTML"
- Commit 6: "Finish bio/about section"
- Commit 7: "Add JS event listeners"
- etc...
- Commit 22: "Adjust styling for new HTML layout"
- Commit 23: "Finish website"

The commit messages here suggest that each commit above addressed a small, often
_singular_ task.

Good commit practices are critical for large companies and organizations where
many developers are working on large code-bases — in these cases, limiting
the size of commits makes it easier for others to understand what changes the
commit brings. If a commit introduces a bug into the code base, it is fairly
easy to revert a _small_ commit. A big commit, on the other hand, may require
lots of extra work to untangle and fix.

For personal development, though, the same concerns apply. In addition, when you
start building more complex projects, you may find yourself in situations where
you'd like to go back to an earlier version of a project. Taking the time now to
build good habits will help you many times over in the future. Think of good
version control habits as a favor to your future self!

## Conclusion

Once you've finished building your website, make sure to push it all up to
GitHub. If you followed our advice and set up GitHub Pages first, you've now
successfully built _and_ published a website! Fantastic work!
